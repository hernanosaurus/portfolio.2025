# Nani's Portfolio 2025 â˜•ðŸ’»

Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio. This is where I showcase my work as a frontend developer â€” projects, skills, and a bit about who I am. Built with love, coffee, and some good vibes.

## What's This About?

This portfolio is a single-page app that tells my story as a developer. It's built with modern tools and follows best practices, because that's how I roll in my projects too.

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - For that sweet type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling (with dark mode!)
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, consistent icons
- **Geist Font** - Clean typography

## Getting Started

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed (v18 or higher recommended).

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd portfolio.2025

# Install dependencies

The page will auto-reload when you make changes. Hot module replacement is your friend here.

## Customizing for Your Own Use

Want to use this as a template? Go for it! Feel free to fork this repo and make it your own. Just please give credit where it's due â€” link back to this repo and don't claim the original work as yours. Here's what you'll want to update:

### 1. Update Your Info

Edit `app/components/sections/Hero.tsx`:

- Change the name, title, and bio
- Update social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)

### 2. Add Your Projects

Edit `app/data/projects.ts`:

- Add/remove projects
- Include project names, descriptions, tech stacks, and links
- Projects with links appear in "Featured Projects"
- Projects without links show up in "Other Projects"

### 3. Update Your Skills

Edit `app/data/skills.ts`:

- Organize skills by category
- Add or remove technologies you work with

### 4. Personalize Metadata

Edit `app/layout.tsx`:

- Update the title and description
- Add your own favicon and OG image
- Customize social media preview cards

### 5. Tweak the Styles

The color scheme uses a warm orange gradient with white backgrounds. To change it:

- Check out `tailwind.config.ts` for custom colors
- Update component class names as needed
- Main page uses `from-white to-orange-50` gradient
- Dark mode works out of the box!

### 6. Customize Animations

Framer Motion animations add personality throughout:

- **Hero section** - Fade-in animations with wiggling coffee & laptop emojis
- **Flame component** - Interactive flame animation effect on hover/tap with seeded randomness for consistency
- **Project cards** - Staggered fade-in on scroll with spring hover effect
- **Footer** - Playful animated emojis (coffee, shaka, music notes)
- Adjust timing/stiffness in component files to match your style
