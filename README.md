# Nani's Portfolio 2025 â˜•ðŸ’»

Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio. This is where I showcase my work as a frontend developer â€” projects, skills, and a bit about who I am. Built with love, coffee, and some good vibes.

## What's This About?

This portfolio is a single-page app that tells my story as a developer. It's built with modern tools and follows best practices, because that's how I roll in my projects too.

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - For that sweet type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling (with dark mode!)
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, consistent icons
- **Geist Font** - Clean typography

## Getting Started

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed (v18 or higher recommended).

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd portfolio.2025

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Fire up the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you're good to go!

The page will auto-reload when you make changes. Hot module replacement is your friend here.

## Project Structure

Here's how things are organized (because clean code matters):

```

### 2. Add Your Projects

Edit `app/data/projects.ts`:
- Add/remove projects
